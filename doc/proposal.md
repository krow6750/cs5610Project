# proposal

Guidance for your project proposal (proposal.md)

## Section headings

The proposal.md should include the following sections:

* Team
  * List names of team lead and team members
* Project goal
* User stories
* UI design
* Project requirements
  * Add a section for each of the project requirements listed in the projects.md (additional guidance below).
  * back end
  * web API
  * data
  * user/admin views

## Project goal

Short description of project goal. This should be concise answer to the following questions:

Are you...

* ...building a site that has blogging functionality?
* ...creating an e-commerce site?  Or a gaming site?
* ...focussing on interactive data visualization or dashboard?
* ...building something else?

## User stories

Describe your user stories following the example in the React app demo...

See: [User story](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_todo_list_beginning#our_apps_user_stories)

If you expect multiple users with different roles, then you should describe multiple users' stories.

## UI design

Describe your UI design.
An example of UI design appears in the mdn browser-extension section at mdn. That example is cited here to give you an
idea of how you might describe your own proposed UI. You have flexibility in how you'd like to approach this
proposal requirement. You may use UML, screen shots from a design tool such as figma.com, or some other approach that provides
comparable information.

  * This link provides examples for design a single web page
* See: [Browser extension UI design](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/user_interface) -- mdn
  * This link provides an example for designing multi-component application
  * It's the design of a web extension, but you can use it as a guideline for designing your web app

## Project requirements

Add a section for each of the project requirements in the projects.md (in the class repo).

While you are expected to synthesize concepts and technologies covered in class, 
you have quite a bit of flexibility here. 
Learning goals for the course include the ability to find, learn, and use additional tools. 
You may therefore replace something that might have been a requirement from the class materials 
with something worthy of the learning goals. 
That means your proposal should answer relevant questions including (but not limited to)...

* Are you proposing a full-stack application?  If not, why not and what will you do instead?
* How will your app use data, including information about and/or provided by your users?
* Will your app have authentication? If not, then how will you address security?
* Will your app have a REST API? If not, why not and what will you do instead?
* Will your app consume data from a web-accessible API? If not, why not and what will you do instead?
* What technologies will you use, and why?
