Guidance for the implementation plan (plan.md) to supplement the project proposal (proposal.md).

The plan.md is a project-management document.

## requirements

* 3 prioritized project objectives
  * provide sufficient detail for project management
  * these will become v0.1, v0.2 and v0.3 for your project
  * you must tag these versions in your github repo
  * provide instructions so instructor/TAs can clone the repo and run each version from the command line
* key tasks
  * create a list of key development tasks
  * list those tasks in the appropriate project objectives
* roles and responsibilities
  * identify a task lead for each of the key tasks
  * the task lead should submit related commits in the github repo

## Example: "Legendary Friends" game app
